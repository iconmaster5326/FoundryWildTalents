# Wild Talents for Foundry

This is a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) system for running games of
[Wild Talents](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/78394/Wild-Talents-2nd-Edition)
(and other [ORE](https://arcdream.com/home/) games that use similar
rules, such as [The Kerberos Club](https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/64271/wild-talents-the-kerberos-club)).

This system includes features for:

- keeping track of Wild Talents characters, including support for custom silhouettes, custom powers, custom skills, and more
- automatically keeping track of point cost for things like archetypes and powers
- rolling dice in the ORE fashion, including interactive dice regrouping and use of alternate hard dice
- GM content creation, letting them make new extras and meta-qualities, change the default skillset, and keep track of minion groups
- initiative, ordering by Sense in the declare phase

## Known Issues

- You can't right-click chat messages in Firefox by default. To fix this on your
  end, you need to go to `about:config` and set
  `layout.css.has-selector.enabled` to `true`, then restart Firefox.

## Special Thanks

- The official Foundry discord, for considerable assistance
- [The one-roll-engine plugin](https://github.com/shemetz/one-roll-engine), for
  d10 sprites
